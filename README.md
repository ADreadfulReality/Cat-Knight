## Introduction
_Cat Knight_ is a fun action-advanture game where you control a knight cat as they journey through the pixel world to fight off slimes, dodge bomb-throwing plants, or conquer bosses through every level. Players can jump, slash, and explore through a dynamimc game world created using the **Phaser framework.**


## Motivation
The idea for _Cat Knight_ came from inspiration by one of my childhood favorite games: Zombotron, and another childhood classic, Plants vs. Zombies. I loved the idea of a classic platformer experience with unique enemies and creative mechanics such as bombs being thrown by plants! My goal was to build a fun and challenging game that blends in quirky pixel cartoon characters with in-game combat (And on the side, I also just wanted to get my Capstone project finished for my Game Design course).


## How to Play
**Movement:** Use arrow keys to move the Cat Knight around. Up arrow key to jump, left arrow key to move left, and right arrow key to move right.
**Attack:** Press the down arrow key to attack enemies like slimes and plants.
**Avoid Bombs, slimes, and more:** Be careful; plants will throw bombs at you and slimes will attack you!

This game isn't as easy as it looks!


## Installation and Running the Projct
To run _Cat Knight_ locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the respository** (if you're using Git):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cat-Knight.git
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code (as I use this to mainly develop):**
   - Click on File > Open Folder... and select the cloned respository folder.
3. **Open the HTML file:**
   - Navigate to the index.html file (or whatever your main HTML file is named).
   - Right-click on it and select Open with Live Server (if you have the Live Server extention installed) to run the game in your browser.
4. **Directly opening the HTML file:**
   - You can also open the index.html file directly into your web broswer by double-clicking it or dragging it into the browser window.

  [SIDE NOTE!: I used AI to generate this part for me, I have never installed or opened other users works before and therefore have no experience :( I also work primarily on my school issued device so I am limited to certain features.]


## Technologies Used
- **Phaser:** For 2D game development.
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript:** To structure and style the game.
- **Visual Studio Code:** To code the game, well duh.

## Things I Wanted to Implement
- Levels after level 1
- Fixing the players jump in the game
- Fixing the slime hitbox or making a new mechnism for it
- Having other mobs in the game
- Adding more player mechnisms

## Challenges Faced
I've faced a **heavy** amount of challenges throught this project and had to create various different test scripts in order to get the result I desired. Even the game now is pretty terrible mechnism wise but least I tried my best. I think the most set back was trying to create multiple spites for me since I'm more used to doing these on development platforms rather than all in a single script. Another thing was trying to make the game more difficult and imlementing hearts for the different mobs in the process. I had a lot of things I really wanted to make in the game but I didn't feel motivated enough to go back to my game and add on after I completed my Game Design course. I also want to move on to other future projects, but I'll come back to Cat Knight eventually.
